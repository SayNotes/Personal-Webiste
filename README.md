My Personal Website

As a Web Frontend, my portfolio contains a number of web projects I've worked on. Examples of these projects include designing the appearance of a website for a client using HTML, CSS and JavaScript, creating a landing page for a marketing campaign by optimizing SEO techniques, and developing interactive features such as animations and hover effects using CSS and JavaScript. I've also added a description of my role in the project, as well as the challenges I faced and how I overcame them. With a structured and attractive portfolio, I'm sure I can attract the attention of potential clients or recruiters, as well as showcase my skills and experience as a reliable Web Frontend.
